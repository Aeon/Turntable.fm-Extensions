A Bookmarklet to add functionality to turntable.fm

Current Features include:

    HTML5 Desktop Notifications for the following: (Chrome Only)
        Chat messages (pretty buggy at the moment)
        Song changes - includes album art if available
        Votes - both up and down with attribution to the voter
        DJ Changes - know when DJs step up to or down from the decks
        Listener Changes - know who has just entered or exited the room

    Auto Awesome support (inspired by J2 Labs' initial implementation which was built based on @Tivs' hack)
